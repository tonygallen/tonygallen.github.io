I am a Computational Imaging Scientist in the [Cyber Resilience and Intelligence Division](https://www.ornl.gov/crid) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. At ORNL, I have worked on problems in synthetic aperture radar, satellite imagery, and biometrics. Generally, my research interests include developing novel imaging systems, optimization, artificial intelligence, and [computational imaging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_imaging).

Prior to joining ORNL, I received a B.S. in Mathematics from West Virginia University and a Ph.D. in Mathematics from Purdue University while working in the Lidar Technology Branch of the Air Force Research Laboratory.
