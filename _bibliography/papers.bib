  annote       = {Nighttime Light (NTL) images provide critical insights into urbanization, disaster response, and energy consumption. The VIIRS Day/Night Band (DNB) sensor offers high-quality NTL imagery with daily revisit rates, but the available spatial resolution hinders fine-grained accurate analysis. Super-resolution techniques aim to increase the resolution of NTL images, enabling more detailed assessments of infrastructure, light pollution, economic activity, and power outages. However, existing state-of-the-art super-resolution methods designed for natural images struggle with the unique characteristics of NTL data. This work provides a comprehensive review of super-resolution methods across multiple image modalities, evaluates their effectiveness on VI-IRS DNB data, and proposes a multi-modal super-resolution approach tailored to NTL imagery. The proposed approach integrates VIIRS DNB data with road networks and land use information to improve reconstruction accuracy and spatial detail.
